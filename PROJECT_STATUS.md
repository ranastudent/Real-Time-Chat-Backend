This document tracks which requirements are already implemented and which are pending.

## ✅ Fulfilled Requirements

- [x] **NestJS setup with Prisma** (connected to Postgres)
- [x] **ChatGateway (WebSocket) running** and accepting client connections
- [x] **Multiple clients can join the same chat room**
- [x] **Client connection verified** (client1 & client2 both receive system messages)

## ⏳ Pending Requirements

- [ ] **Message persistence**  
  - Save chat messages into Postgres via Prisma
  - Retrieve past messages when a client joins a room

- [ ] **Room management**  
  - Users should be able to create or join multiple rooms
  - Track users in each room

- [ ] **User authentication**  
  - OTP auth with phone number  
  - Device enforcement (limit sessions per device)

- [ ] **System events**  
  - Notify when a user joins/leaves  
  - Keep a list of active participants

- [ ] **Error handling & validation**  
  - Prevent empty/invalid messages  
  - Handle disconnections gracefully

## 📌 Next Steps

1. Implement **chat persistence** (Prisma model for `Message`, save + fetch history).  
2. Add **room management** (create/join multiple rooms).  
3. Extend with **OTP + device enforcement**.  
4. Polish with **error handling + system events**.
